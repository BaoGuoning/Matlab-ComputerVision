The Cropped Buoys have many images, but they are not from every frame. The naming of the cropped buoy images
is messed up, multiple images were taking for the same frame to ensure that all of the buoy 
was taken. 

To prevent water from being in the images, the cropped buoys couldn't perfectly get the whole
buoy, so multiple crops were used to get the whole buoy for one frame.
